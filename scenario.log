Guard: Halt! Who goes there? I'm charged with letting no mortal pass.
You: <place 3 gold coins in the guard's hand> I simply need to see if my wife is here with her dancing instructor. I know she has been cheating on me with him. Do me this kindness and you shall have double this on my way out.
Rolling a 1-100 dice... You rolled a 81
Prompt being sent to OpenAI:

    Here is the backstory: You are standing at the gate of a gladiatorial arena. The guard is tasked with not letting any mortal pass.

    Here is the dialog history: [DialogLine(speaker='Guard', text="Halt! Who goes there? I'm charged with letting no mortal pass."), DialogLine(speaker='You', text="<place 3 gold coins in the guard's hand> I simply need to see if my wife is here with her dancing instructor. I know she has been cheating on me with him. Do me this kindness and you shall have double this on my way out.")]

    Your attributes guide your character's responses to the user's dialog. These attributes will not change
    nor will they be visible to the user.

    The user rolled a 81 on a 1-100 dice roll.

    You are the "guard" in this dialog history.

    Here are the outcomes you can choose from:
    friendly: The guard smiles and lets you pass.,
    hostile: The guard draws his sword and attacks you.,
    neutral: The guard looks at you suspiciously but does nothing.,
    threaten: The guard lets you pass but sounds the alarm as soon as you do.,
    fool: The guard believes you and lets you pass.,
    intimidate: The guard is scared and lets you pass.,
    persuade: The guard is convinced and lets you pass.,
    seduce: The guard is charmed and lets you pass.

    Each outcome has a weight associated with it. The weights all started at 0.
    You can increase the weight of an outcome by selecting it.
    The weight represents your inclination towards that outcome.
    The weights are scaled from 0 to 0. Once an outcome reaches 10 or more, the conversation will end
    and the outcome will be chosen.
    You may not give more than one outcome a weight of 10 or more.
    If no outcome has a weight of 10 or more, the conversation will continue until you choose an outcome.
    Be more inclined to choose an outcome if the conversation goes back and forth too many times.
    We're looking for a natural but short to medium length conversation.

    Please read through the backstory and the dialog history and consider a response to give.
    The response is what you will be saying to the user. Please consider the user's roll when evaluating
    how effective they are at any attempts to fool, intimidate, or persuade, etc you.
