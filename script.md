## AI amazing but it has some problems:

- inconsistant and non-deterministic results | any result is techncially possible... including no result
- comparitive computational tasks are very slow and expensive.
- Example: ask ai to compare two versions of the same document and if you want all diffs prescisely to the character and line/column number, it will take a long time, be more of an opinion and cost a lot. It might be qualititatively better for  why you're wanting to compare but it won't be in a format potentially required if it is meant to be input to another piece of software. Comparing docs is super fast, easy and predictable for regular function calls.
- trust. If we are to automate systems, we need to be able to trust the automation. Regular functions are predictable and can be trusted. AI is not predictable and can't be trusted.

## How can structured Outputs help?

- Speed and cost. What if it is entirely possible to use normal functions to accomplish most of the task and only use AI for the parts that require an actual intelligence?
  - Most of the process would run at the expected lightning speed but you'd still get the enhancement of AI where it is needed.
  - This is how the NVIDIA new GPU architecture works. The 5090 is getting a lot of critisism for just being a more powerful 4090 that is somewhat linear with performance increase compared to the cost increase. Except where it is able to inject AI simulations into the rendering in which case it combines speed with simulated frames at much higher rates than actual rendering. But the entire thing is not AI, just the parts that need it.

- Deterministic results. If you can structure the output of the AI, you can get a deterministic result. And other software needs a contract on what the format can be.

- Trust. If your results are deterministic within a range that can be evaluated by traditional means, you can trust the results. If you can't trust the results, you can't trust the automation.

## Why do I care?

Imaging a video game just like the ones that you're used to. But instead of prescripted dialog and actions, the player is having a much more open discussion with the characters. You can inform the game on how to evaluate and who it is. Then the game lets the ai pick the outcomes that are possible. The outcomes still need to be predictable in this scenario unless we want the game to be a text-only adventure. We need to know how to modify the game data and what to show on the screen. But we can use AI to make the game far more immersive and interesting.
